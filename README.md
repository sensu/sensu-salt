# Sensu-Salt

Your source to use Senu with SaltStack.

There is already a SaltStack Formula, [saltstack-formulas/sensu-formula](https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/sensu-formula). They are in the repositories of the SaltStack formulas.

In addition, the Formulas for [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/salt-formulas/salt-formula-rabbitmq) and [Redis](https://github.com/salt-formulas/salt-formula-redis) are also interesting.

## Legacy
This project recently declared a mulligan due to the lack of recent maintenance. You can still pull the old code by checking out the following commit `69ea0682e86ebc0a2b3ce70dd13a7abddff3f0b8` and browsed [here](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-salt/tree/69ea0682e86ebc0a2b3ce70dd13a7abddff3f0b8). To make it easier to transition we have created a new branch called `legacy` as well which can be found [here](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-salt/tree/legacy).
